Implementation of the BMFR denoising technique was orientated on the [original implementation](https://github.com/maZZZu/bmfr) but adapted and ported from [Example Project](https://github.com/gztong/BMFR-DXR-Denoiser). BMFR was released together with the [2019 paper "Blockwise Multi-Order Feature Regression for Real-Time Path Tracing Reconstruction"](https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/papers/Koskela-TOG-2019-Blockwise_Multi_Order_Feature_Regression_for_Real_Time_Path_Tracing_Reconstruction.pdf). Implementation depends on [Foray Library](https://github.com/Vulkemp/foray).
